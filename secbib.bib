  abstract	= {Our growing reliance on online services accessible on the
		  Internet demands highly available systems that provide
		  correct service without interruptions. Software bugs,
		  operator mistakes, and malicious attacks are a major cause
		  of service interruptions and they can cause arbitrary
		  behavior, that is, Byzantine faults. This article describes
		  a new replication algorithm, BFT, that can be used to build
		  highly available systems that tolerate Byzantine faults.
		  BFT can be used in practice to implement real services: it
		  performs well, it is safe in asynchronous environments such
		  as the Internet, it incorporates mechanisms to defend
		  against Byzantine-faulty clients, and it recovers replicas
		  proactively. The recovery mechanism allows the algorithm to
		  tolerate any number of faults over the lifetime of the
		  system provided fewer than 1/3 of the replicas become
		  faulty within a small window of vulnerability. BFT has been
		  implemented as a generic program library with a simple
		  interface. We used the library to implement the first
		  Byzantine-fault-tolerant NFS file system, BFS. The BFT
		  library and BFS perform well because the library
		  incorporates several important optimizations, the most
		  important of which is the use of symmetric cryptography to
		  authenticate messages. The performance results show that
		  BFS performs 2% faster to 24% slower than production
		  implementations of the NFS protocol that are not
		  replicated. This supports our claim that the BFT library
		  can be used to build practical systems that tolerate
		  Byzantine faults},
